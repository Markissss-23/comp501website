<h1>AI Chatbots in Society</h1>

<p>Our group has decided to research the impacts AI Chat-Bots have on society. Artifical Intelligence (AI) chatbots are quickly transforming our way of interacting with technology. Programs powered by natural language processing (NLP) can hold conversations that feel like you are talking to a human. This website we made delves into the interesting world of AI chatbots, exploring their capabilities, the opportunities they offer, and the potential risks they pose. Finally we'll also talk about the choices we can make to ensure that AI chatbots are developed and used responsibly and to our benefit.</p>
