<h1>AI Chatbots</h1>

<h2><p>What are AI chatbots?<p></h2>

<p>AI chatbots are a digital partner that you can have a conversation with, capable of answering your questions, gives you information and
even can keep you company. Thats essentially what AI chatbots can do. But what exactly are they, and how are they impacting today's society?</p>

<!-- How they work -->
<h3>How Do They Work?</h3>
<p>These chatbots utilize a combination of thesethree key technologies:</p>
<ul><p>NLU: Natural Language Understanding, this is the ability to understand what the intent is behind human language(s). Analysing the context, grammar and semantics of inputs to grasp what the user is asking</p></ul>
<ul><p>NLG: Natural Language Generation, this is the technology that generates human-like responses to requests or queries.</p></ul>
<ul><p>NLP: Natural Language Processing, this is the overarching term that encompasses both NLU and NLG. NLP allows chatboss to process, understand, and generate human language responses, being the fundamental building block for interactive experiences.</p></ul>

<!-- History -->
<h3>Short History of Chatbots</h3>
<p>Chatbots have been around for quite some time, with ELIZA and ALICE being the earliest creation in the 1950’s and 1966, laying the groundwork for modern-day ai chatbots. These chatbots used pattern-matching and rule based methods to simulate a conversation. 
  
  Modern chatbots however, have evolved significantly since ELIZA and ALICE. Utilising both machine learning and deep learning, gaining the ability to continuously learn and improve their responses over time. 
  
  Some popular examples of these chatbots include Siri (Apple), Alexa (Amazon), and Google Assistant. Moreover, language models like ChatGPT are growing in popularity, pushing the boundary of chatbot capabilities.

<h3>The Future of Chatbots</h3>
<p>AI chatbots' future depends mainly on proper implementation and continuous improvement of their functionalities. The
following are key areas chatbots can evolve:</p>
<ul><p>Improving NLP; Although NLU and NLG are the cornerstones of interactivity in chatbots, there is a lot of room fo significant improvement. Benefitting from a deeper and more profound understanding of context, cultural nuances and even sarcasm in language. Achieving this will allow for a more natural and engaging conversation for the users, reducing any misunderstandings.  </p></ul>
<ul><p>Emotional Intelligence; As of now, chatbots focus on the literal meaning of words. Integrating emotional intelligence, albeit difficult, would allow chatbots to recognise, understand and respond to the emotional tone in user inputs. Tailoring responses to user’s emotions can improve the conversational ability of chatbots.  </p></ul>
<ul><p>Personalisation; While being capable of personalisation to a certain extent. Improvements that enable chatbots to personalise interactions on a higher level would drastically improve the experience. Image a chatbot that can remember user preferences, past interactions while also tailoring its responses accordingly. </p></ul>
<p>As AI continues to improve, chatbots will most likely become even more sophisticated and integrated into our daily lives. While experiencing the large number of potential benefits, it's also important to note the potential risks.  </p>
