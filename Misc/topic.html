<h1>AI Chatbots</h1>

<h2><p>What are AI chatbots?<p></h2>

<p>AI chatbots are a digital partner that offer more than just scripted conversations. They can understand your questions and queries, provide relevant information, and even engage in casual conversation about many topics, serving as a companion of sorts. essentially what AI chatbots can do. But what exactly are they, and how are they impacting today's society?</p>

<!-- How they work -->
<h3>How Do They Work?</h3>
<p>These chatbots utilize a combination of these three key technologies:</p>
<ul><p>NLU: Natural Language Understanding, this is the ability to understand what the intent is behind human language(s). Analysing the context, grammar and semantics of inputs to grasp what the user is asking</p></ul>
<ul><p>NLG: Natural Language Generation, this is the technology that generates human-like responses to requests or queries.</p></ul>
<ul><p>NLP: Natural Language Processing, this is the overarching term that encompasses both NLU and NLG. NLP allows chatboss to process, understand, and generate human language responses, being the fundamental building block for interactive experiences.</p></ul>

<!-- History -->
<h3>Short History of Chatbots</h3>
<p>Chatbots have been around for quite some time, with ELIZA and ALICE being among the earliest creations since way back in
the 1950’s and 1960’s, laying down the groundwork for modern-day AI chatbots.</p>
<p>ELIZA, devleoped by Joseph Weizenbaum, was one of the first chatbots that can simulate conversations. It utilised
pattern-matching and keyword recognition to respond to inputs by the user. Albeit with limited capabilities, ELIZA
sparked our interest in the potential of what AI can do with natural language interactions. The other notable chatbot at
the time was ALICE. Developed by Richard Wallace, ALICE was another chatbot that used pattern-matching and rule-based
systems, focusing on mimicking the way humans converse, it even won the Loebner Prize for Turing-test deception many
times. Both of these examples were groundbreaking for their time; however it pales in comparison to modern chatbots.</p>
<p>Chatbots today have evolved significantly since the days of ELIZA and ALICE. Utilising both machine learning and deep
learning. Machine learning allowed the chatbots to continuously learn and improve their responses over time through
analysing large and extensive datasets. Deep Learning enabled chatbots to simulate complex decision-making processes of
the human mind, resulting in more human-like responses.</p>
<p>Popular examples of these chatbots include Siri (Apple), Alexa (Amazon), and Google Assistant. Additionally, language
models like ChatGPT are pushing the boundaries of Chatbot capabilities, demonstrating the untapped potential of chatbots
for even more sophisticated and intelligent conversations.</p>

<!-- Future of Chatbots -->
<h3>The Future of Chatbots</h3>
<p>AI chatbots' future depends mainly on proper implementation and continuous improvement of their functionalities. The
following are key areas chatbots can evolve:</p>
<ul><p>Improving NLP; Although NLU and NLG are the cornerstones of interactivity in chatbots, there is a lot of room fo significant improvement. Benefitting from a deeper and more profound understanding of context, cultural nuances and even sarcasm in language. Achieving this will allow for a more natural and engaging conversation for the users, reducing any misunderstandings.  </p></ul>
<ul><p>Emotional Intelligence; As of now, chatbots focus on the literal meaning of words. Integrating emotional intelligence, albeit difficult, would allow chatbots to recognise, understand and respond to the emotional tone in user inputs. Tailoring responses to user’s emotions can improve the conversational ability of chatbots.  </p></ul>
<ul><p>Personalisation; While being capable of personalisation to a certain extent. Improvements that enable chatbots to personalise interactions on a higher level would drastically improve the experience. Image a chatbot that can remember user preferences, past interactions while also tailoring its responses accordingly. </p></ul>
<p>As AI continues to improve, chatbots will most likely become even more sophisticated and integrated into our daily lives. While experiencing the large number of potential benefits, it's also important to note the potential risks.  </p>
