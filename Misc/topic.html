<h1>AI Chatbots</h1>

</ul><h5><p>What are AI chatbots?<p></h5>

<p>AI chatbots are a digital partner that you can have a conversation with, capable of answering your questions, gives you information and
even can keep you company. Thats essentially what AI chatbots can do. These chatbots utilize a combination of these
three key technologies:</p>
<ul><p>NLU: Natural Language Understanding, this is the ability to understand what the intent is behind human language(s)</p></ul>
<ul><p>NLG: Natural Language Generation, this is the technology that generates somewhat human-like responses to requests or queries.</p></ul>
<ul><p>NLP: Natural Language Processing, this is the overarching term that encompasses both NLU and NLG.</p></ul>

<p>Chatbots have been around for quite some time, with ELIZA and ALICE being the earliest creation in the 1950’s and 1966.
They are computer programs with the ability to simulate conversations using self-learning or rule-based AI methods. The
chatbots take the users questions and respond either by audio or by text, which you may be familiar with programs such
as Apple’s Siri or Amazons Alexa. Modern chatbots have become increasingly popular, with ChatGPT being among the most
used. However, we must ask ourselves if the increase of these programs is good for society?</p>
