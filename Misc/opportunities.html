<h1>Opportunities</h1>


<h2><p>What opportunities do chatbots make for society?<p></h2>

<p>AI chatbots provide opportunities for society. Once relegated to simple tasks such as basic customer service interactions, evolving into tools that can benefit many parts of society. Including education, healthcare, marketing and more!</p>

<!-- Education -->
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>Modern-day chatbots are making waves in the education sector. Research suggests that incorporating chatbots into the learning environment can provide many benefits for both the students and educators. Here are some examples as to how chatbots are transforming modern education.  </p>
<ul><p>Student Support: Unlike human tutors, chatbots have an on-demand availability, giving students the ability to have assistance whenever they need it. Proving to be helpful for solving issues or doubts outside of the classroom, helping with questions and also guidance on assignments.  </p></ul>
<ul><p>Personalised Learning: chatbots are/can be programmed to adapt to the user’s needs. By learning about a student’s strengths and weaknesses, it can provide material that is targeted towards said weaknesses. Fostering a more personalised learning journey that can cater to a student’s underlying abilities.  </p></ul>

<!-- Healthcare -->
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<p>Another sector that could benefit from ai chatbots is healthcare, specifically the Indian healthcare. Studies address the issues of Indian rural healthcare, with 63.8% of the population having insufficient access to health facilities. The implementation of chatbots could bridge those communities, with opportunities such as appointment scheduling, symptom analysis, medication reminders and medical advice readily available and accessible to the public.  Furthermore, chatbots provide a cost-effective solution for both people and the health sector. </p>

<!-- Marketing -->
<h3>Marketing</h3>
<p>Since chatbots are essentially programs/software that can hold a conversation with people, it can have several uses in a marketing setting. Chatbots can be found on platforms such as Facebook’s messenger, capable of doing the following:</p>
<ul><p>Providing customer service, being able to answer and support customers with most queries they have.</p></ul>
<ul><p>Personalised marketing messages, this may result in more sales/traction for a business.</p></ul>
<ul><p>Handling transactions, they can easily sort out transactions to specific groups to make it easier to store and track.</p></ul>
