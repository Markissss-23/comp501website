<h1>Opportunities</h1>

<h2><p>What opportunities do chatbots make for society?<p></h2>

<p>AI chatbots are quickly evolving from simple tasks such as being a simple customer service tool to more complex and
powerful applications that can benefit many aspects of society. Chatbots are creating many opportunities in education,
healthcare, marketing and way more other sectors.</p>

<!-- Education -->
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>Modern day chatbots are making a significant impact on today’s education sector, offering a wide range of benefits for
both students and teachers. Research suggests that incorporating chatbots into the learning environment can make the
learning experience more engaging, accessible and personalised.</p>
<p>Unlike human tutors, chatbots offer on demand availability, this provides students with the ability to get near
instantaneous assistance whenever they need it. This is extremely helpful for students who need help or assistance
outside of the regular classroom and time. Chatbots today can act as a study partner, offering explanations on topics or
concepts, clarifications, and provide step by step solutions to complex problems</p>
<p>Chatbots are/can be programmed to adapt to the user’s needs. It can do this by analysing the user’s strengths and
weaknesses through their interactions. With this information, it can personalise the learning experience by providing
the user targeted resources and materials. By doing so, students can focus on areas where they need the most help,
instilling a deeper understanding of the topic.</p>
<p>Teachers also drastically from the recent introduction of chatbots, being able to support them by doing repetitive
routine tasks such as scheduling, grading and even providing information to students. This gives the teachers more time
to focus on personalised teaching, class planning and student interaction. Just like my point before this, chatbots can
also collect data on students such as their progress and learning style, giving teachers more information and allowing
them to tailor their teaching methods to provide better support for students individually.</p>
<p>Overall, the recent popularity of chatbots and their integration into education offers a lot of promising opportunities
to everyone as a whole. As the technology continues to improve, chatbots are likely to play an important role in the
future of education.</p>
<!-- Healthcare -->
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<p>The healthcare sector can have significant gains with the implementation of AI chatbots. Within the Indian healthcare
sector, studies show that 63.8% of the population lack proper access to healthcare facilities, chatbots can offer a
promising solution that can bridge this gap. Since chatbots can be trained to do a variety of tasks, it can help the
healthcare sector in various ways.</p>
<ul><p>Diagnosis; if trained to analyse symptoms and provide initial assessments, chatbots can guide users towards the
appropriate medical attention that they need. Helping to identify potential and current health issues and interventions.</p></ul>
<ul><p>Mental health; Being able to provide a safe and anonymous environment for individuals who are struggling with mental
health issues. Although it may not be adept now, it can provide emotional support, resources and even basic therapy.</p></ul>
<ul><p>Language Accessibility; It can also be trained to be able to handle multiple languages, overcoming language barriers and
allowing information to be accessible to everyone.</p></ul>
<p>With the massive untouched potential AI chatbots have, it can have a drastic impact on the healthcare sector for many
countries in the world.</p>
<!-- Marketing -->
<h3>Marketing</h3>
<p>Since chatbots are AI programs designed to interact and converse with humans, it can be a powerful tool for marketing
and sales. You can find chatbots on platforms such as Facebook’s Messenger, capable of enhancing the customer’s
experience and growth of the business. Here are some things chatbots can do for marketing:</p>
<ul><p>Customer Service; Chatbots can provide instant support, having the ability to address customer inquiries and resolve
issues at any time of the day, even outside of regular business hours. This completely removes any wait times and
potential frustrations from customers.</p></ul>
<ul><p>Personalised Marketing; Chatbots can gather information about the customer by analysing interactions and other past
data, such as demographics, purchase history, etc. Using these to tailor responses and recommendations, which can result
in a more engaging experience for the customer. Thereby increasing sales for the business.</p></ul>
<ul><p>Transactions and data; Chatbots can manage online transactions and data. Being able to collect and analyse data about
customer’s buying patterns, preferences and feedback. This data can then improve marketing campaigns and customer
experience.</p></ul>
