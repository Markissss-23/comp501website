<h1>Technology Risks</h1>
<h2><p>What risks do chatbots pose for society?<p></h2>
<p>Chatbots have recently become increasingly mainstream, and people are finding uses for it in various fields, including
education, mental health, and healthcare. While AI chatbots offer many undeniable benefits, it's important to address
the several potential risks associated with their use.</p>

<!-- Education -->
<h3>Educational Misuse</h3>
<p>A major concern is the potential for educational misuse, primarily due to an AI chatbot’s ability to generate human-like
responses. This results in chatbots like ChatGPT to be used by students to write essays for them, complete assignments
or even to cheat on exams. When students abuse their use of chatbots, it undermines the learning process and can lead to
over dependency on AI for problem solving and critical thinking. Furthermore, since AI chatbots make decisions based on
context, it can result in insufficient or inaccurate responses if the prompts are written accordingly. While it is still
far away from reality, it's also important to mention that AI chatbots could eventually completely replace teachers,
being seen as more effective than human teachers, resulting in job losses.</p>

<!-- Healthcare -->
<h3>Healthcare Concerns</h3>
<p>To counteract a previous point, since chatbots require data to function, it collects and stores patient data to function
properly, including sensitive medical information. This raises several concerns about data privacy and security. The
data collected is used to train AI models with machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). While healthcare
regulations such as HIPPA emphasize the confidentiality of patient’s data. The current accessible versions of chatbots
such as ChatGPT do not comply with these standards. This raises several concerns about the storage of patient’s personal
information, data breaches and the misuse of data.</p>

<!-- Mental Health -->
<h3>Mental Health</h3>
<p>Psychological AI chatbots are used for mental health support but also display unique risks. Contrary to human
therapists, these chatbots lack the ability to fully comprehend nonverbal cues and respond with empathy to someone in
emotional distress. This can result in vulnerable users relying purely on chatbots for support, without understanding
its limitations, potentially neglecting the need for human interaction and professional care. This also means
vulenarable populations can flock to this alternative due to barriers and issues in traditional methods. Another point
that needs to be addressed is potential algorithmic bias within the data that can lead to harmful advice, leading to
inappropriate conversations that could further distress users.</p>

<!-- Regulation and Governance -->
<h3>Regulation and Governance</h3>
<p>As chatbots become more intelligent and is integrated into many different sectors of society, the need for regulatory
frameworks and guidelines are becoming ever more necessary. This is especially true for areas such as healthcare,
education, and mental heatlh, where ethical considerations and data privacy need to be properly addressed. Governments
around the world need to develop clear standards and guidelines for the development, deployment and use of these
chatbots. Addressing guidelines for data privacy and security, transparency, non-discrimination and fairness, and most
importantly safety and security. There should also be oversight frameworks in place to monitor these chatbots and their
compliance with the regulations, this can be done by user reports and auditing.</p>

<p>While Chatbots offer many exciting opportunities, it's important to acknowledge and address the risks associated with
their use. Implementing safeguards and responsible development can ensure that chatbots contribute positively to society
without compromising ethical values and the well-being of its users.</p>
